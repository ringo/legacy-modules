# legacy-modules
Frozen legacy modules extracted from Ringo's core modules. These modules have been removed with RingoJS 0.12 and can
be installed via rp for older applications:

* `rp install ringo-mustache`
* `rp install ringo-markdown`
* `rp install ringo-jsdoc`

This packages will only get security updates and using them is no longer recommended. Instead of mustache we
recommend the [reinhardt](http://packages.ringojs.org/packages/reinhardt) templating engine. An alternative to
the old markdown parser is the CommonMark port [commonmark](http://packages.ringojs.org/packages/commonmark).
